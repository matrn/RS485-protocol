RS485 protocol for Arduino and linux C
==========

This arduino library and C code serve for communication between arduinos and linux computer.

## Getting Started

For arduino copy whole directory named RS485protocol to your libraries directory. For C use compilation command from **C compilation**.

## Directories

 * RS485protocol - arduino library
 * RS485protocol_C - C code

## Arduino usage

Arduino example is stored at `RS485protocol/examples/RS485protocol_basic_usage/RS485protocol_basic_usage.ino`

## C compilation

In directory RS485protocol\_C run command `gcc RS485protocol.c functions.c -o RS485protocol`
